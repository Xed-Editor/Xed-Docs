# Publishing Your Plugin

Xed-Editor does **not** yet have an automated publishing system.

**Announce your plugin**  
   Post it in the official community channels (**DO NOT SPAM**):
   - [Discord](https://discord.gg/6bKzcQRuef)
   - [Telegram](https://t.me/XedEditor)
   - [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Xed-Editor/Xed-Editor/discussions)

### Future plans

An official plugin repository with browse/search/auto-update support is planned.  
When it lands, plugins hosted on GitHub Releases will be automatically discoverable.

Until then, GitHub Releases + community announcement is the fastest and most reliable way to reach users.
